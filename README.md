NFL Management System â€“ CSV Reader and Writer
Developed a CSV Reader and Writer in Java as part of an NFL Management System, enabling efficient file parsing and data management. Over the span of 3 days, the feature allows the system to read data from CSV files, showcasing all pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) including inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. This project highlights my ability to integrate real-world data management with solid OOP principles.
